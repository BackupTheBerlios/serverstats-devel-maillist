<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Looks really nice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I don't like about AJAX is the dependency on JS. This can be some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addon, but should not be the only way to browse the tree/graphs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We must move with the times ... ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Ajax is fashion,  I use it with my xforms engine and works very well !
</I>
But Serverstats is not about fashion, it is about KISS (&quot;keep it small
and simple&quot;). Thats the reason why I created Serverstats (Cacti was so
bloated) and I think that should stay one of the main goals.

So, like I said: JS can extend the script, but it should not be the only
way to navigate through graphs. Perhaps some JS could take the layout,
add AJAX to it, but keep the current html intact.

I like AJAX and love to use websites that take advantage of it, but I
dislike creating webpages that are not browseable without JS. Perhaps
thats one of the things you care about if you start having a
community[1] of webdevs and always need to tell them: &quot;Don't use JS
here, you will keep 35%[2] of your possible visitors from using your
homepage&quot;.
[1] <A HREF="http://www.webmasterpro.de/">http://www.webmasterpro.de/</A> (german)
[2] according to the statistics calculated by all users (about 122000)
of the Flashcounter (<A HREF="http://fc.webmasterpro.de/">http://fc.webmasterpro.de/</A>)

&gt;<i> I've just test  with this little update and seems that not works :( ...
</I>&gt;<i> I've missed a thing ?
</I>&gt;<i> Tree must have possibility to &quot;group by&quot; to organize all hosts and graphs.
</I>&gt;<i> [...example...]
</I>
Your example works here.

&gt;<i> On the page detail.php.  I've got a warning message in the menu :
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>
This is fixed now, forgot to load $tree and $filter inside detail.php.

&gt;<i> So what about  xmlconfig ? when do you think that you could include it
</I>&gt;<i> to the main trunk ?
</I>
xmlconfig seems to work, but currently it's only an addon to the
configuration. I don't know how far it is possible, but I thought it was
meant to replace the old configuration?

Besides the xmlconfig only makes real sense if we have a working editor
for it. It's not very usable and intuitive to edit XML-files with a
text-editor (At least not the format you suggested). Perhaps thats the
problem of the old config-format, too...but it has worked so far. :)

Greetings, David Danier
