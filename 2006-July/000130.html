<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the idea, but dislike to rebuild XSLT-features inside PHP to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used in XML-files.
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean  ??? I don't have rebuild nothing whith a php 5.1 it's ok
</I>
You rebuild the usage of XPath like it is done inside or XLST.
(&quot;{foo/bar}&quot; is executed as an XPath expression)

&gt;&gt;<i> Besides this could be more powerful, for example it should be possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to delete the params after they were used (to be more flexible and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only limited to @name). That leads to the problem, that it may only be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deleted after the last access.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> This is not limited to @name ... This an xpath expression  that use as
</I>&gt;<i> context node the current node
</I>
It is limited to existing, valid elements inside the XML-tree. So if you
want to have more complex parameters it's not possible to do something
like that:
--------8&lt;----------------------------------------------------
	&lt;param name=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
		&lt;list name=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;
			&lt;value name=&quot;xx1&quot;&gt;yy1&lt;/value&gt;
			&lt;value name=&quot;xx2&quot;&gt;yy2&lt;/value&gt;
			&lt;value name=&quot;xx3&quot;&gt;yy3&lt;/value&gt;
		&lt;/list&gt;
		&lt;value name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;yyy&lt;/value&gt;
	&lt;/param&gt;
----------------------------------------------------&gt;8--------

If you want to use this with AVT (&quot;{../param[@name='foo']}&quot;), the
&lt;param&gt; stays inside the original document, which may lead to invalid
XML-documents.
So you are somehow limited to existing parameters like @name, which
might be a problem if you want to have complex parameters.

&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * config (root)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * value (string, attr: name (optional), children: text)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * list (array, attr: name (optional), children: &lt;value&gt; and/or &lt;list&gt;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * class (to load classes, attr: name, children: &lt;value&gt; and/or &lt;list&gt;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * param (param used for the templates, attr: name, children: text)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If name is omitted for &lt;value&gt; or &lt;list&gt; it is used like $array[] =
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;something&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure ...
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is more complicate like this ...
</I>
Thats mostly the same as yours, only the elements are renamed (array and
value splited into 2 elements, param renamed) and a new element &quot;param&quot;
is added.
&lt;sources&gt; for example is nothing more like &lt;list name=&quot;sources&quot;&gt; and can
be some alias for that...as said later:
&gt;<i> Some &lt;list&gt;-Elements could of course be replaced by elements that have
</I>&gt;<i> more semantic (like: &lt;sources&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, &lt;graph&gt;, ...)...but I think
</I>&gt;<i> to describe this here &lt;list&gt; is enough (and closer to the current
</I>&gt;<i> config).
</I>
&gt;<i> I must use  xpointer  to only insert childs and not parent node 
</I>&gt;<i> (template nodename is useless)
</I>
I don't really understand, what you are trying to say here. :/

&gt;<i> avt must be used into attribute not into text element
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N1575.html">http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/sect2/N1575.html</A>
</I>
Why don't create something dirrefern, perhaps more flexible or
appropriate? :)
I was not talking about AVT here....

As written before I said we could use some kind of stack that lists all
&lt;param&gt;-elements defined below all 'ancestor-or-self'. So you don't have
to use some XPath to point to them, they are just there and you can
access them. And you could delete the &lt;param&gt;-elements when they are not
needed anymore....

Example:
--------8&lt;----------------------------------------------------
&lt;foo&gt;
	&lt;bar&gt;
		&lt;param name=&quot;foo1&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/param&gt;
		&lt;bla&gt;
			&lt;param name=&quot;foo2&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/param&gt;
		&lt;/bla&gt;
		&lt;fasl /&gt;
	&lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;
----------------------------------------------------&gt;8--------

Now, let's iterate over the elements (&lt;param&gt; excluded, does nothing
special):
&lt;foo&gt;: stack is empty
&lt;bar&gt;: stack is filled with param &quot;foo1&quot;
&lt;bla&gt;: stack is filled with params &quot;foo1&quot; and &quot;foo2&quot;
&lt;/bla&gt;: param &quot;foo2&quot; is deleted from the document (not used anymore)
&lt;fasl&gt;: stack is filled with param &quot;foo1&quot;
&lt;/bar&gt;: param &quot;foo1&quot; is deleted
&lt;/foo&gt;: nothing exciting

&gt;&gt;<i> But this does not avoid the ploblem, that we have to rebuild some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XSLT-features inside PHP, so perhaps it would be easier to just _use_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XSLT:
</I>&gt;<i> Explain ... ??? Why you want to rebuild XSLT ?
</I>
Your rebuilding (/implement) the AVT-feature of XSLT inside PHP.

&gt;&gt;<i> Some &lt;list&gt;-Elements could of course be replaced by elements that have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more semantic (like: &lt;sources&gt;, &lt;source&gt;, &lt;graph&gt;, ...)...but I think to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> describe this here &lt;list&gt; is enough (and closer to the current config).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> It's always better to use xml inside namespace ...
</I>
Sure, omitted this to have less to write.

&gt;<i> ... and define type using
</I>&gt;<i> standard like rdf or w3c schema
</I>
Half true. It's always the best to use a language that fits your needs
and is simple and small by doing so (KISS).
If there are appropriate standards, fine, but if not it's most of the
time better to write something new than having to fight with some
existing standards that only fit at some place (and in the worst case
have to combine many of them). (The main feature of XML is the &quot;X&quot;)

The only things you are currently using are:
 * xinclude (which are in my examples, too)
 * xsi:type (which I replaced with an own element)
 * AVT (which I think is not flexible enough, but you can convince me of
the opposide)

&gt;<i> This is why my xml files seems to be a little complicate  but with
</I>&gt;<i> xforms it's easier to parse and manipulate as this.
</I>
Why?
If you have the elements &lt;source&gt;, &lt;sources&gt;, &lt;graph&gt;, ... it should be
nearly the same.
Of course the whole template-stuff (using XSLT or my &lt;param&gt;) could not
be easily changed with such an editor.

So we have two (or three) possible solutions:
 * extend the AVT-thing to be able to delete the nodes it loads the
values to get more complex parameters working (perhaps have some
&lt;delete&gt;-element)
 * use one of the ideas I write about
 * convince me, that AVT is enough (and that there are no cases where
the only possiblity to set a value-attribute is not enough)

I don't see how the SimpleConfig-stuff could be included into XML-config
(means: replaced by some XML-app) easily with only AVT.
Perhaps we could allow xinclude, AVT and create some
XSLT/&lt;template&gt;-stuff like I proposed to replace SimpleConfig?
